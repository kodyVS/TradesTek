### Extra Information

Times may be messed up for you on the time in and out feature as I hard coded my timezone. Adjust this line to fix : ./views/TimeManager.vue line 150 and 188 and change the number of hours subtracted for UTC time.

Employees are normally made in quickbooks and then imported into this app.
